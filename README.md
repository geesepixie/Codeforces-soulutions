This repository serves both as a personal archive and as a ledger of progress in competitive programming.

# Notes

Files are named as: ProblemLetter_Problem_Title.cpp (e.g., A_Sum_of_Round_Numbers.cpp).

Problems are solved in contest order (A, B, C …).

I prioritise readability first, then micro-optimisations.
